Package: hexocart
Title: Hexagonal and cartogram transformation of spatial objects.
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("John", "Curiel", email = "jcuriel@mit.edu", role = c("aut", "trl", "cre"))
Description: The hexocart pacakge reads in regular polygon shapefiles and transforms them into a 
	hexagonal grid. The hexagonal transformation is a minor alteration of the makeTilegram pkg, 
	with the main update being that the user now has the data frame preserved, which was not the
	case in the previous version. The hexcarto function in turn creates a hexagonal cartogram in 
	such a manner that the user will not have hexagons overlap on top of each other, and 
	additionally preserves the location and overall shape of the area of interest.
